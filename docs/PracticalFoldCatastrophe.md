# Practical Fold Catastrophe

Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.

A `Fold Catastrophe` models a disaster in the form of a `tipping point` or `point of no return`. This occurs when a 
single `dimension` or `parameter` named `a` is greater than `0`.  In other words:

```kotlin
fun isCatastrophic(a: Double): Boolean {
    return if (a > 0) {
        true
    } else {
        false
    }
}
```

## Standard Deviations

A standard deviation measures `dispersion` in a system.  Obviously, this is of great interest to those actively 
pursuing, or are being pursued by, the `Great Work` or `Magnum Opus` of the spiritual path of `Initiation` in the new 
Aeon of the Crowned and Conquering Child.

In other words, by alchemically combining `Catastrophe Theory` and `Occult Engineering`, we cam measure key metrics in 
Lodge activity and any standard deviations from the expected result.  As the standard deviations increase, we expect 
this present `Talisman` to illustrate cascading ruin wrought by dispersion in the form of `Catastrophe` manifested as 
`Magickal Attack`.

Calculating a `Standard Deviation` comes in two forms; one to measure the standard deviation of an entire population 
and another to measure the SD of a subset of the total population.

In our examples of a hypothetical Lodge of the Outer Circle, we will make our calculations easier by assuming the Lodge 
to be it's own self-contained population.

## Practical Application of One Dimension

Let's say we have a small Lodge of 3 members.  Let's say we want to track frequency of Dues payment and any standard 
deviations from the norm (which is "yes, Dues were paid this month").
